Web Programming with Ruby, Sinatra and SQL Project for Code Clan

The Brief:

Travel Bucket List
Build an app to track someoneâ€™s travel adventures.

The app should allow the user to track countries and cities they want to visit and those they have visited.
The user should be able to create, edit and delete countries
Each country should have one or more cities to visit
The user should be able to create, edit and delete cities
The app should allow the user to mark destinations as visited or still to see
Possible Extensions:
Have separate pages for destinations visited and those still to visit
Add sights to the destination cities
Search for destination by continent, city or country
Any other ideas you might come up with

I gave my app a yoga theme and named it ZenTracker. Find new yoga experiences and keep track of places you have visited.
Enlightenment is just around the corner...

To run this app:
1. Create a psql database named zen_tracker and run the following command:
psql -d zen_tracker -f db/zen_tracker.sql
2. Run the file db/seeds.rb
3. Run the file controller.rb
4. Go to localhost:4567 in your browser
